# Math_game

"""This code defines a Game class that encapsulates the game logic. An instance of Game represents a game session. 
The Game class has methods to calculate the GCD , LCM , MULTIPLY_FRACTIONS and DIVIDE_FRACTIONS
check the players answer, generate the next question, and start the game. 
The game window is created in the Game constructor and the first question is generated.
 The start method starts the game loop The game keeps track of the players score and the number of wrong answers. 
The game ends after 3 wrong answers and shows the final score. From level 3 onwards, 
the game includes multiplication and division of fractions. Please note that this is a more advanced example and 
assumes some familiarity with object-oriented programming in Python. You should be able to run this code in your 
local Python environment, as long as you have the Tkinter library installed 
(it comes pre-installed with standard Python distributions).This is still a quite basic GUI 
and there are many ways you could enhance it, such as adding graphics, sound, high score tracking, a help system, etc. 
Building a high-quality educational game could be a large project'"""
